    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      I’m a freelance editorial designer, based in Pordenone (Italy).<br />
      I deal mainly with editorial design, that is overseeing the layout of texts for printing: theses, papers, books, brochures, leaflets, flyers, business cards...<br />
      I’m also experienced in editing and processing vector images.<br />
      I can therefore help you create a logo and process your <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#immagine_coordinata">corporate identity</a>, or promote your company through the study and implementation of a <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#company_profile" >company profile</a>.<br />
      My background? I am a classicist.<br />
      Beginning as a ‘classical philologist’, I continued as an ‘archaeologist’ and finally landed on ‘graphic design’.<br />
      Hence the union of <strong>culture</strong>, <strong>precision</strong>, <strong>punctuality</strong>, <strong>order</strong>, <strong>rigour</strong> and <strong>creativity</strong>!<br />
      What else? I'm pretty good at spotting typos and following Italian grammar rules and syntax!
